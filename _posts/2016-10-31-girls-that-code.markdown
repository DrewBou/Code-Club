The computer programming field has a huge gender imbalance! In 2013, only 18% of students taking the AP Computer Science test were women. Those who take the AP Computer Science test are eight times more likely to major in Computer Science! This is a huge problem because more and more jobs are opening up in the computer science field. By 2020, it is expected that 52% of STEM job openings will be in the computing and mathematics sector.
