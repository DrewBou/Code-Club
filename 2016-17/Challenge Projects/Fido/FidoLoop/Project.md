# Fido and While Loops

Fido the coding dog is playing hide-and-seek with his friends Rex and Spot
- Fido is it!
- He needs help counting up to one-hundred, and the faster he counts, the sooner he gets to look for Rex and Spot
  - Help Fido count up to 100 really fast by writing some code!

Requirements:
- Must use a while loop to print numbers 1-100
- When fido is done counting, have it print "ready or not, here I come!"

Hint:
```java
public class FidoWhile {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Put code here!
  }
  // This runs after the loop is done
}
```
