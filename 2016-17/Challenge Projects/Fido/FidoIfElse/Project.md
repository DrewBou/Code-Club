#### Our coding feathery friend Tom needs help! ####
Tom wants to be able to count his feathers with some Java, but he doesn't know how!
Given how many feathers Tom has, let's print out a rough estimate of how many feathers he has.

Tom wants to know if he has more than 10 feathers, at least one feather, or no feathers.

### Requirements ###
- Must be written in Java
- If Tom has more than 10 feathers, lets say "Tom has a lot of feathers!"
- If Tom has at least one feather, lets say "Tom has some feathers!"
- If Tom doesn't have any feathers :( lets say "Tom has no feathers!"

### Hints ###
- We will have to use a conditional statement here.
  - try an if...else if...else statement

```java

class Tom {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    //put your conditional statement here
  }
}

```
