- Start with the first two lines
- Write an integer variable
- Print out the value of the variable
- If the variable is less than 3, print "less than three"
- If the variable is equal to 3, print "that's the magic number!"
- Otherwise, print "greater than 3"
- If x is not equal to three, set it equal to three
- Create a new variable, and set it equal to 3 times the other variable
- Write a while loop, where our second variable is decreasing by one until it equals 1
  - inside the while loop, print "yay for loops!" followed by the variable value

```
That's the magic number!
yay for loops!
yay for loops!
yay for loops!
yay for loops!
yay for loops!
yay for loops!
yay for loops!
yay for loops!
yay for loops!
```
