## Fido The Coding Dog ##

 #### Our coding furry friend fido needs help! ####
Fido wants to be able to organize his bones with some Java, but he doesn't know how!
Given how many bones fido has, let's give print out a rough estimate of how many bones he has.

Fido wants to know if he has more than 10 bones, at least one bone, or no bones.

### Requirements ###
- Must be written in Java
- If fido has more than 10 bones, lets say "Fido has a lot of bones!"
- If fido has at least one bone, lets say "Fido has some bones!"
- If fido doesn't have any bones :( lets say "Fido has no bones!"

### Hints ###
- We will have to use a conditional statement here.
  - try an if...else if...else statement

```java

class Fido {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    //put your conditional statement here
  }
}

```
