## Richard the human needs help planning his Thanksgiving Feast!

![Happy Thanksgiving!](https://esiagrad.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/happy-thanksgiving-turkey.gif)

Richard wants to know how much food he needs for his thanksgiving feast
- If each person eats 2 pounds of food, how much food will Richard need?

Richard also wants a rough estimate. He wants to know if he needs a lot of food, a little bit of food, or no food
  - If Richard needs no food, print "Richard must have no one coming for thanksgiving :("
  - If Richard needs less than 20 pounds, print "Richard needs quite a bit of food."
  - If Richard needs more than 20 pounds, print "Richard needs a lot of food!"

Remember, we always need to start with this:
```java
public class Thanksgiving {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Code Goes in here!
  }
}
