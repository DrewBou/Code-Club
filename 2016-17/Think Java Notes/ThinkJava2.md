### Chapter 2

**Declaring variables**
Variable - a named location that stores a value
Value - can be a number, text, images, sounds, and other data types
- values must be stored as variables
-variables are declared with a name and type

```java
String message;
```
- here a new variable named message is declared with type String
- variables are case-sensitive
- some words like *public, class, static* cannot be used as variable names because they are reserved

**2.2 Assignment**
- variables must be assigned a value (initialized) before being used

**2.3 State diagrams**
- the use of an equals statement is an assignment, not a statement of equality
  - if you type *a = 7* that is not the same as *7 = a*
- variables can change values

**2.4 Printing variables**
- variables can be printed by using the variable name (identifier) in the print statement:
```java
String firstLine = "Hello, again!";
System.out.println(firstLine);
// prints "Hello, again!"
```
Using variable names also works with other types, such as integers:

```java
int score = 10;
System.out.print("the current score is ");
System.out.println(firstLine);
// prints "the current score is 10"
```

**2.5 Arithmetic operators**
Operators - symbols that represent simple computations
- check operators folder for full list of operators
Operands - the values operators work with

**2.6 Floating-point numbers**
