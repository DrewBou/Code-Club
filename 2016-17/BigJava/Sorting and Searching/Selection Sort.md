# Selection Sort

Sorting Algorithm: rearranges the elements of a collection so that they are stored in sorted order

[Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort): Algorithm to sort a list of integers

- in big-Oh notation, a selection sort algorithm has n<sup>2</sup> time complexity (written as *O(n<sup>2</sup>)* )

big-Oh notation: the language we use to articulate how long an algorithm should take to run
  - the worst case-scenario in how long the algorithm could take to run
  - doesn't measure the algorithm by time, but rather by how many operations must be performed
  - f(n) = O(g(n)) means that *f grows no faster than g*
