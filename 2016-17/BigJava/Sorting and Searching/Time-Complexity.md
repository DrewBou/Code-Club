# Time complexity

## Big-Oh notation
big-Oh notation: the language we use to articulate how long an algorithm should take to run
  - the worst case-scenario in how long the algorithm could take to run
  - doesn't measure the algorithm by time, but rather by how many operations must be performed
  - f(n) = O(g(n)) means that *f grows no faster than g*
